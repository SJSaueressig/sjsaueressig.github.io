## **Notes and summaries for all subjects in school**

This website suits the single purpose of giving all of you some additional notes for learning purposes.
Here you can find my self-written summaries to the school lessons and the source files. All the source files can also be found in Microsoft Teams or Mebis.

Additionally you can find an alternative version of this repository [here](https://myLogic207.github.io).

## **Please note that this website is still under construction! Most of the links won't work yet. The pdf-files are unavailable too.**
