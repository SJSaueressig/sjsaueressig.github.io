## **Transcripts for school**

This website suits the single purpose of giving all of you some additional notes for learning purposes.
Here you can find my self-written summaries to the school lessons and the source files. All the source files can also be found in Microsoft Teams or Mebis.

Additionally you can find an alternative version of this repository [here](https://myLogic207.github.io).

Generally I will update this site as often as possible, but at least once a day after school. Outside of school the site can be unavailable for maintenance.

## Navigation

Please use the sidebar on the left side of the screen to navigate. There is a page for every subject with an overview of all the Transcripts as well as a collection of all pdf-files for the subject.
