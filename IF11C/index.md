# **Notes and summaries for all subjects in school**

This website suits the single purpose of giving all of you some additional notes for learning purposes.
Here you can find my self-written summaries to the school lessons and the source files. All the source files can also be found in Microsoft Teams or Mebis<br>
Additionally you can find an alternative version of this repository [here](https://myLogic207.github.io).
